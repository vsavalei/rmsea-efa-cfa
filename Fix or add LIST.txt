FEATURES TO ADD OR BUGS TO FIX:

1. (3/28/2022) When all crossloadings are zero, sometimes R's way of printing zero is a very small number instead, 
but ggplot adjusts the y-axis in the graph manually, creating what looks like huge differences on first glance. Try this:
p=10
fcor=.2
l=rep(.7,10)
cld=rep(0,10)
rmseas<-rmsea.2f(p=p,fcor=fcor,l=l,cld=cld)
rmseas

The value is 0.000000e+00 for no cross-loadings and then 7.228125e-09 for all subsequent cases, even though they should be zero.
Solution: give ggplot some minimum y-axis range to plot? I think the minimum range should always include the grey 
horizontal lines: so it should be a bit above .08 for RMSEA and SRMR, and a bit below .9 (or .95) for CFI.  

[Semi-FIXED] 2. The limit on CL and CR should show rounded to two decimal places in the sliders.
2.1 Solve the overlapping anchor 

[FIXED] 3. Hovering does not yet work (see Break Alpha app) 

4. Specify Manually does not yet work (least priority, may be removed in the end)

5. Add the option for 3 factors

6. Replace: "1 minus squared main loading, minus squared crossloading, and minus twice the factor correlation times 
the main loading times the crossloading" with a math expression. Advanced: Any way to print the values of added loadings under
the graphs on the x-axis? Too fancy? 

7. Try different positioning of plots so that all three are visible right away, if possible. 
They are too big and definitely too wide. Plots for RMSEA and SRMR could appear side by side. CFI could be below it. 
OR maybe all three can be in one row, just small. Especially if hovering works, this may be sufficient. 

8. Plots are ugly. Lines should be thinner, dots should show actual data (see Bill's FMI app).

9. Eventually, add the feature where the fitted model holds the factors to be orthogonal (I need to modify code here in the functions.R)
